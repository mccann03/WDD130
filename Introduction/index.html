    <h2>Dylan McCann</h2>
    <p>
        Hello, my name is Dylan McCann. I am from Vancouver, Washington. My hobbies include reading, 
        building models, baking, and occasionally playing video games. I am open to most genres of books and
        video games, except those that pertain to horror or tragedy. I prefer to make French confectionaries
        when I am baking, because of how unique they are and good they taste.</p>
    <p>
        My family consists of me, my younger brother, my mom and, my dad. I am a hard worker that focuses on
        the task I am given until completion, sometimes even to the point that I forget other stuff that I 
        am supposed to do.</p>
    <p>Currently I am majoring in applied technology, and hope to use the knowledge acquired from the courses
       I will take to be able to work equally well with both software and hardware. Currently I am living at 
       home while working part-time and doing online schooling. Since my parents do not charge me rent, on my 
       days off I work on projects around the house. My favorite food during the summer is watermelon, and I 
       am really looking forward to getting my hands on some eggnog this winter.</p>
