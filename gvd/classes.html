                    <h2>Technology</h2>
                    <p>The technology class teaches various types of hardware and software that are used to design things such
                        as websites and online advertisements. Furthermore, instructors when teaching about these technologies

                        should make their usage easier for those that have little or even no experience using computers.  After
                        this class students should have the ability to create webpages without any help using the most recent
                        graphic design software and hardware.

                        similar to the ones taught in the two classes above, but more in-depth and complex. Things that will 
                        be taught in this course include how to alter website programming, what different parts of the code do,
                        and how and what one can do in this code to make a website more applying. Finally, at the end of this
                        course student will be allowed to put what they want to the test by putting together a website of their
                        own that will display everything they have learned, and challenge them to show to themselves and
