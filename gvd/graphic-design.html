                        Graphic design is the arrangement and creation of elements in a manner that is visually pleasing
                        to the viewer. That said the term graphic design, while having remained mostly unchanged has been
                        altered in our modern day and age to mean something slightly different than what it has meant in
                        decades past. Now a days graphic design means more than working with a pen and paper, with the 
                        rise of computers it has also become necessary for one to have a decent understanding of 
                        technology to become a graphic designer. Additionally, computers have also opened more types 
                        of jobs such as photo editor and multimedia designer, that are focused on certain aspects of 
                        graphic design and deal with their own specific technology used to make it.

                    <p>
                        At its core graphic design is made of various aspects that can be broken up into eight different
                        elements, which include line, shape, form, texture, space, imagery, typography, and color. Lines
                        are considered the basis of graphic design as they can be used for anything, from outlining an
                        object to dividing content. Shape can be considered an extension of line, as it involves using 
                        lines to make object of various appearances and designs. Form is the aspect of graphic design
                        that involves giving depth to shapes, to make them three dimensional. Texture creates an even
                        deeper level of depth on three-dimensional objects by creating surface quality or imperfections
                        in the surface of the object, which brings a higher level of realism to it. Space is the usage
                        of background and design, and the balance achieved in a graphic design from proper application
                        of the two. Imagery is the use of images in a design and placing them in a manner that brings
                        out the best in that design. Typography is similar to imagery; however, it differs in that it
                        makes use of words and fonts rather images. Finally, color is the aspect that is responsible for
                        bringing out the right amount of similarity and contrast in an image to make it great.
