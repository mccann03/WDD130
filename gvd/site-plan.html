        Graphic design is defined as the skill of creating and arranging visual elements in things 
        like books, advertisements, and websites in a manner that either visually entices or stimulates
        the looker. This website focuses on improving one’s graphic designing abilities by teaching 
        them skills dealing with graphic design through a variety of classes that might help to 
        improve their skills or understanding of this concept. To be more a little bit more specific 
        these classes will provide help and guidance with one’s artistry skills, explain about the 
        technology used regarding graphic design, and demonstrate how to use the previous two skills 
        to create things such as websites, online advertisement, and visuals in computer games.

      <h3>Graphic Design</h3>
      <p>
      Basic info <br>
      Graphic design is the arrangement and creation of elements in a manner that is visually pleasing
      to the viewer. That said the term graphic design, while having remained mostly unchanged has been
      altered in our modern day and age to mean something slightly different than what it has meant in
      decades past. Now a days graphic design means more than working with a pen and paper, with the 
      rise of computers it has also become necessary for one to have a decent understanding of 
      technology to become a graphic designer. Additionally, computers have also opened more types 
      of jobs such as photo editor and multimedia designer, that are focused on certain aspects of 
      graphic design and deal with their own specific technology used to make it. 
      <br><br> Aspects <br>
      At its core graphic design is made of various aspects that can be broken up into eight different
      elements, which include line, shape, form, texture, space, imagery, typography, and color. Lines
      are considered the basis of graphic design as they can be used for anything, from outlining an
      object to dividing content. Shape can be considered an extension of line, as it involves using 
      lines to make object of various appearances and designs. Form is the aspect of graphic design
      that involves giving depth to shapes, to make them three dimensional. Texture creates an even
      deeper level of depth on three-dimensional objects by creating surface quality or imperfections
      in the surface of the object, which brings a higher level of realism to it. Space is the usage
      of background and design, and the balance achieved in a graphic design from proper application
      of the two. Imagery is the use of images in a design and placing them in a manner that brings
      out the best in that design. Typography is similar to imagery; however, it differs in that it
      makes use of words and fonts rather images. Finally, color is the aspect that is responsible for
      bringing out the right amount of similarity and contrast in an image to make it great.

      <h3>Classes</h3>
      <p>
      Art <br>
      This class teaches the fundamentals of art including color, contrast, balance, value, and form,
      and how to apply these principles to graphic design. Additionally, classes will be taught with 
      computers so that students can get a better understanding of how to use them for graphic design,
      and how software is used in the design process. Lastly, this class will provide students with an
      environment that will encourage their creative growth, and expression of individuality in their
      own unique way through independent study assignment when they may express their creativity in 
      any way they desire.
      <br><br> Technology <br>
      The technology class teaches various types of hardware and software that are used to design things such
      as websites and online advertisements. Furthermore, instructors when teaching about these technologies
      will also provide hands on useful suggestions and tips in addition to hands on support when need, that
      should make their usage easier for those that have little or even no experience using computers.  After
      this class students should have the ability to create webpages without any help using the most recent
      graphic design software and hardware.
      <br><br> Website Design <br>
      This class focuses on helping individuals build detailed and beautiful webpages and teaches concepts 
      similar to the ones taught in the two classes above, but more in-depth and complex. Things that will 
      be taught in this course include how to alter website programming, what different parts of the code do,
      and how and what one can do in this code to make a website more applying. Finally, at the end of this
      course student will be allowed to put what they want to the test by putting together a website of their
      own that will display everything they have learned, and challenge them to show to themselves and 
      everyone else that they can go beyond expectations.
